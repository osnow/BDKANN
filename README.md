# BDKANN
Biological domain knowledge based artificial neural network 

Scripts for implementing BDKANN and BDKANN+ in addition to baselines on drug response data from GDSC and CTRPv2. 

Model_tuning is for finding optimal hyperparameters, Model_evaluation tests best models on different data splits, and recover_connections removes some biological knowledge connections and finds what percentage recovers
